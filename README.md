Comparative Study of ML Algorithms in predicting the Drag Coefficient of Non_Spherical Particles

## Project Overview :
### Objective:
To compare various machine learning algorithms in predicting the drag coefficient of non-spherical particles using features such as Reynolds number and shape factor of particles.The drag coefficient is a crucial parameter in fluid dynamics, playing a significant role in understanding the behaviour of particles in fluid flows. For non-spherical particles, predicting this coefficient accurately is challenging due to the complex interactions between particle shape and fluid dynamics.
                                                               This study aims to compare various machine learning algorithms in their ability to predict the drag coefficient of non-spherical particles. By leveraging different approaches, we seek to identify the most effective methods for this prediction task.
